So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian 🙈)\\nThe good part! Quantity 😍\\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\\nThe breads and raita were decent!\\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step 🙈\\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

Little disappointing when starters are not hot.\\n\\nFish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.\\nVeg spring rolls were too good.\\nBig surprise for me is Onion rings as starters 🤣😂\\n\\nKadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.\\nChicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.\\n\\nFor the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.\\n\\nSuggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.\\n\\nOverall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.</th>\n",

While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.\\n\\nBest for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing.

Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great!

Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.\\n\\nBest for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush .\\n\\nThe service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great!

Lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. Being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all. The most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of Koma' menu. The taste was as described on the menu. Lust in particular was something different I'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusion️.The appetizers we had we're really good, something I enjoyed more than the alcohol.Dragon prawns, Grilled pomfret, Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders! Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.Best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush .The service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! It's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'Comatose' .Here's my overall SCORE:Food - Ambience - VFM - Service -</th>\n",
